## ARMv8 CPU / Kernel / Memory Context

### CPU Perspective (ARMv8-A)
The MMU in ARMv8-A is enabled by writing bit 0 (M) of SCTLR_EL1 to 1 via an MSR instruction followed by an ISB. The ISB is the critical barrier: it flushes the instruction pipeline so that all instructions fetched AFTER the ISB use the new memory system configuration. Before the MMU is enabled, the CPU operates in a flat physical address space. After the bit is set, the TLB, page-table walker, TTBR0/TTBR1, TCR_EL1, and MAIR_EL1 all become active simultaneously. There is no intermediate state.

### Kernel Perspective (Linux ARM64)
Linux enables the MMU in __enable_mmu (arch/arm64/kernel/head.S), called from __primary_switch. The sequence is:
  1. Write TTBR0_EL1 (identity map root).
  2. Write TTBR1_EL1 (kernel map root).
  3. ISB to synchronize TTBR writes.
  4. Write SCTLR_EL1 with M=1 (via set_sctlr_el1 macro).
  5. ISB to flush the pipeline.
  6. RET -- the very next instruction is fetched through the new MMU.
The identity map ensures that the physical address of the code after the RET is also mapped at the same VA (PA==VA), so no instruction-fetch fault occurs.

### Memory Perspective (ARMv8 Memory Model)
The moment SCTLR_EL1.M is written to 1 and the ISB completes, the ARMv8 memory model transitions from "flat PA" to "two-stage VA->PA via page tables". The identity map (stored in __idmap_text_start to __idmap_text_end, mapped in the .idmap.text section) covers the physical pages of the MMU-enable code so the VA==PA invariant holds during the critical window. Without the identity map, the instruction fetch for the RET after set_sctlr_el1 would target a VA that has no valid TLB entry, causing a translation fault with no exception handler installed yet.
